Thus checks and balances between counterbalancing influences of the ecosystem is essential.</p> <h2 id="lucky-platform-is-built-on-luck"><a href="#lucky-platform-is-built-on-luck" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> LUCKY platform is built on LUCK</h2> <p>LUCK is the fundamental method of interacting with the Lucky smart contracts: players make wagers, game makers and affiliates get paid and stakers will receive profits, all in LUCK.</p> <p>LUCK is utilized in several ways:</p> <ul><li>LUCK is the sole token used to purchase in-game credits ( e.g. spins and chips ) and therefore the sole means of playing casino games powered by Lucky technology</li> <li>Game creators in the game creation marketplace are paid in LUCK</li> <li>Casino affiliates and white-label casinos will finance casinos solely with LUCK, pay their licensing fees with LUCK and receive revenues in LUCK</li> <li>Fees charged throughout the system will be charged in LUCK, this LUCK will be sent to the governance fund for the first three years of operations. Subsequently fees related issue will be decided by stakers voting on governance.</li> <li>LUCK can be “staked” by funders of casino bankrolls with returns paid in LUCK</li></ul> <h2 id="luck-issuance"><a href="#luck-issuance" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> LUCK Issuance</h2> <p><strong>Design Goals:</strong></p> <ul><li>LUCK tokens will be created during one event at launch. Subsequently 100 million LUCK tokens will be minted annually after 3 years at a low inflation of 1% to upkeep the LUCKY platform.</li> <li>Over time, LUCK should become more valuable as the active number of players and games running on the LUCKY platform grows</li> <li>Increases in the value of LUCK should not result in LUCKY licensed casino games becoming more expensive to play</li></ul> <h2 id="token-allocation"><a href="#token-allocation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Token Allocation</h2> <p><strong>Token Supply Details</strong><br> <img src="/lucky-onepager/table1.png" alt="table1"><br>
LUCK token is designed with a fixed token supply during its first 3 years followed by an annual token emission with declining inflation. The token emission of 100 million LUCK token minted annually will represent 1% or lower of the token supply. Distribution of these token emission will be issued to the platform and players at a 4:1 ratio.</p> <p>Token distribution to the platform would be credited into the LUCKY governance fund.
Token distribution to the players would be voted by the self-governance DAO. This could take the form of a raffle, affiliate referrals, transactional mining or other mediums. <br></p> <p><strong>Token allocation percentage</strong><br> <img src="/lucky-onepager/table2.png" alt="table2"><br>
Token allocation percentage are structured to incentivize participants as the ecosystem grows.<br></p> <p><em>Players</em> are expected to come onboard slowly in the beginning thus we have a slight increase in token allocation percentage to cater for this expected larger user base.</p> <p><em>Affiliates</em> will play a crucial role during the early days for adoption thus we allocate a higher token allocation percentage which decrease over the 3 years.</p> <p><em>Developers</em> are essential to bring fresh and interesting games and experiences to the platform. Since the dynamics doesn’t change, token allocation percentages will be kept flat over the 3 years.</p> <p><em>Lucky Platform</em> will take on the responsibility of operations and development until the self-governance phase kicks in. Therefore token allocation is kept flat over the 3 years. Token emission after the 3rd year helps the Lucky platform with operational cost.</p> <p><em>Lucky Platform Capital</em> is the token allocation assigned for players to trade with. Since most players will require LUCK tokens to start playing, they will need to trade for LUCK on exchanges. Once fully redeemed, this tranche of token allocation will be fully distributed to the community.</p> <p><strong>Breakdown of Token allocation</strong><br> <img src="/lucky-onepager/table3.png" alt="table3"><br></p> <p>As per the above token allocation percentage, listed here are the actual token numbers over time.</p> <p>LUCK has a flat emission curve during the 1st 3 years where LUCKY tokens are distributed to the community through transactional mining. This emission curve is designed to create a slower inflationary effect while rewarding early adopters.</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Year 1:</strong>
We will be focusing on incentivizing the players and this is done by rewarding them with 800 million tokens ( the highest tranche of distribution ) through transactional mining rewards. Affiliates would be proportionally incentivized by a 600 million tranche of referral rewards.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Year 2:</strong>
Player incentives increases as a whole due to a larger amount of players on the Lucky platform. Individual received incentives should be lower since the pool will be splitted among a larger number of players. Affiliate rewards decrease slightly as adoption increases.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Year 3:</strong>
Player incentives increases again while affiliate rewards decreases. This is designed to match the expected adoption of the platform</p></li></ul> <p><strong>Inflation Rate of Lucky Token</strong><br> <img src="/lucky-onepager/table4.png" alt="table4"><br></p> <h2 id="decentralised-autonomous-organisation"><a href="#decentralised-autonomous-organisation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Decentralised Autonomous Organisation</h2> <p>Lucky platform is designed to eventually be self-sustaining after the governance DAO system is up and running.</p> <p>Governance include the following aspect of operations that is being handled by the Lucky team during the 1st 3 years:</p> <ul><li>Appointing the management team to handle operations of the Lucky Platform</li> <li>Voting on key operational metrics like gaming odds, staking percentage returns etc.</li> <li>Marketing budget to continuously attract users on to the platform</li></ul> <h2 id="staking-mechanics"><a href="#staking-mechanics" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Staking Mechanics</h2> <p><strong>LUCKY token staking</strong><br>
Online casinos are a single point of failure where players might be exposed to platform hacks or exit scams by the operators. At Lucky, we believe that by decentralizing the platform operations we can eliminate this bottleneck and hand over the reins of operation to the community.</p> <p>Token staking solves two issues in decentralising Lucky; Capital required for bankrolls &amp; Governance / Maintenance of the Lucky platform.</p> <p>To maintain a fair distribution process, all LUCK tokens are given out to the community based on the amount they transacted on the Lucky platform. This will ensure that those with the most participation and vested interest will be able to make good decisions for the community.</p> <p><strong>Formula:</strong><br>
User’s Profit = (User’s Staked Tokens / Total Staked Tokens ) * Total Platform Profit<br></p> <p><strong>The reward calculation are as follows:</strong> <br> <img src="/lucky-onepager/table5.png" alt="table5"><br></p> <p>Players can the benefit of the following when staking LUCK tokens:</p> <ol><li>Governance - Being able to participate in governing LUCKY by voting on gaming odds and eventually other facets of the LUCKY platform.</li> <li>Profit Share - Stakers can earn income by becoming the house on LUCKY. Casinos earn through defined odds, thus in the long run stakers would be able to earn a stable income on their tokens. This will helps the LUCKY platform maintain sufficient liquidity to pay out players.</li></ol> <p><img src="/lucky-onepager/table6.png" alt="table6"><br></p> <ul><li><p><strong>Minimum Staking Amount</strong>: 10,000 LUCKY [ 0.0001% of total supply ]</p> <p>Lucky staked rewards are tabulated at the last day of each month and distributed on the first week of the following month. Staking will be calculated based on daily average and snapshot of staked holdings will be taken daily. Tokens will then be distributed on the first week of the following month.</p> <p>Staked tokens can be redeemed safely and withdrawn by the second week of the following month. This one week delay is to cater for any dispute or delay in rewards distribution.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Staking Implementation</strong></p> <p>Stakers would need to run a computation node to redeem staked rewards on the network. Computation nodes provides a pseudo random vector that serves to create a provably fair gaming condition for all players playing on Lucky.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="governance-mechanics"><a href="#governance-mechanics" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Governance Mechanics</h2> <p>With the eventual goal of decentralized gaming, there will be a need for governance to still make decisions on the operational aspect of the LUCKY platform:</p> <ol><li>Developers building the games</li> <li>Marketing of the LUCKY platform</li> <li>Affiliates rewards</li> <li>Odds of games</li> <li>Payouts to stakers</li> <li>Lucky governance fund</li></ol> <p><strong>1. Developers building the games</strong><br>
There is always a need for new games to entice players to the platform, thus incentives will still be necessary to entice new developers on to the platform. Developer incentive will therefore be needed to amend higher or lower with the changing token price and engagement rate of the platform</p> <p><strong>2. Marketing of the LUCKY platform</strong><br>
With high interaction on the Lucky platform, marketing will not be crucial. However if players engagement starts to decline, marketing budget will help attract fresh players to the platform</p> <p><strong>3. Affiliates rewards</strong><br>
Similar to how marketing will work, affiliate referrals leverages the social aspect to gain new players on to the platform</p> <p><strong>4. Odds of games</strong><br>
In order to incentivize and balance the intake of fees and profit to upkeep the platform, gaming odds might be required to change from time to time. Such scenario include periods where there are too few players and too many stakers.</p> <p><strong>5. Payouts to stakers</strong><br>
In every game, there is the player making a bet and the platform taking the bet. The platform have the house edge due to the preset gaming odds. However when there are fewer players than stakers, it causes imbalance where there isn’t sufficient players to earn from; stakers earn less as a result. This creates disincentives for stakers leading to a downward vicious cycle.</p> <p>Payout and gaming odds acts as the “monetary policy” lever to incentives the ecosystem participants.</p> <p><strong>6. Lucky governance fund</strong><br>
Lucky platform takes a small fee for every game played into its governance fund. The Lucky governance fund is used for platform operations. Upon reaching the self-governance phase, the fund will be managed by stakers through making decisions of appointment holders and eventually where the funds may be spent on. Some expenditure may fees for exchange listing, marketing, reward programs for players etc.</p></div> <div class="content__footer-container"><div class="content__footer"><!----> <!----></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
